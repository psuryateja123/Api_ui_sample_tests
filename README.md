#### Running tests: Considered that you have already cloned the project. You can run tests by typing behave in the commandline

* Type
```
behave
```
* To run specific tests using tags
```
behave --tags=@NAME_OF_THE_TAG
```

* In this project, I have configured two tags, @ui_test - for running all the tests related to the UI and the @api_test for runnging all the tests related to API.

* All the UI tests will run on a chrome browser.

Also integrated [Allure report](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/). This acts like a runner and also helps to generate reports.

* To run specific tests by using tags
```
behave --tags=@NAME_OF_THE_TAG -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o RESULTS_FOLDER ./features

```
* In this project, 

```
behave --tags=@ui_test -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o RESULTS_FOLDER ./features

```

* To view results, after running the tests

```
allure serve RESULTS_FOLDER
```
